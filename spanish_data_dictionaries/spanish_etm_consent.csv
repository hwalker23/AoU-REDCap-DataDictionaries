These activities will collect new types of data from you. They will measure things like:</span></p> <ul> <li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">the amount of time you are able to concentrate on a task without getting distracted</span></li> <li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">your process for making some decisions</span></li> <li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">how long it takes you to respond to a question or prompt</span></li> <li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">how often you respond correctly</span></li> <li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">your ability to recognize emotions</span></li> </ul> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Please read the following information carefully. We will tell you more about these activities and how your participation can help researchers. At the end, we'll ask you if you want to take part in Exploring the Mind. You can choose 'yes' or 'no' and still participate in All of Us.</span></p></div>",,,,,,,,,,,,,

They may be short exercises, quizzes, or puzzles. For example, one activity may ask you to look at pictures of faces and decide if they are happy or sad. Another may ask you to press a button when the screen shows a certain picture or to guess how many dots are on the screen. We may add new activities over time.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Before you do an activity, we will tell you about it. We will tell you about any accessibility limitations it may have. You can decide if you want to do that activity or not. You can choose to do some activities and not others.</span></p></div>",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We still have a lot to learn. We are also learning the best ways to study the mind. If you take part in Exploring the Mind, you can help with both!</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Your data from Exploring the Mind will be combined with data from other All of Us participants. The strength of All of Us is that our hundreds of thousands of participants reflect the many different people across the U.S. These people live in different circumstances and different environments and are at different life stages. Data from Exploring the Mind may help researchers find patterns about how our minds work across these differences. </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">For example, data from Exploring the Mind can be used to look at things that influence our attention spans. Like time of day or average amount of sleep. They can be used to study when in life people get better at recognizing emotions. Or how different conditions may affect reaction speed or accuracy.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">These data can also help researchers see how well the activities measure things about our behavior and cognition. They can use this information to improve the activities or develop new ones to get more helpful data for research.</span></p></div>",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We will add it to the All of Us databases. We will not include your name or other information that directly identifies you.</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Researchers can use data from these activities to study many topics, including:</span></p> <ul> <li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Mental health and mental health conditions</span> <ul> <li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">l</span><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">ike depression or schizophrenia</span></li> </ul> </li> <li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Behavioral health and behavioral health conditions</span> <ul> <li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">like gambling or substance use disorder</span></li> </ul> </li> <li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Development and changes in thinking and reasoning over the lifespan</span></li> </ul> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Researchers want to study these activities for all kinds of people with all kinds of brains.

Some activities will:</span></p> <ul> <li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">have rapidly changing or flashing images.
