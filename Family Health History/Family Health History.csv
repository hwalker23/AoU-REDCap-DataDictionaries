familyhistory_familymedicalhistoryaware,family_health_history,"Please answer each question as honestly as possible. There are no right or wrong answers to any of the questions. It is important that you answer as many questions as you can. We are looking for your own answers and not what you think your doctors, family, or friends want you to say.

Don't feel like you have to spend a long time on each question. The first answer that comes to you is usually the best one. If you aren't sure how to answer a question, choose the best answer from the available choices. Some questions also let you say if you don't know an answer or would rather not answer.

This module asks you about your family's medical history, including medical conditions that your biological parents, grandparents, siblings, or children currently have or have had in the past. Understanding your family's experiences with medical issues can tell us a lot about what kinds of medical issues might be related to your genetics. Genetics has to do with traits that are passed down from generation to generation in a family.

You will be asked questions about your family. Think only of people you are related to by blood including those living or deceased.",radio,"How much do you know about illnesses or health problems for your parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters, and/or children?","FamilyMedicalHistoryAware_Alot, A lot | FamilyMedicalHistoryAware_Some, Some | FamilyMedicalHistoryAware_None, None at all",,,,,,,,,,,,
