study_information,healthcare_access_and_utilization,,descriptive,"This survey asks questions about your access and use of health care. This is to better understand how they may affect health. To ensure your privacy, your name will be separated from your answers before they are shared with researchers. 

It will take about 10-15 minutes to answer these questions. Please answer each question as honestly as possible. There are no right or wrong answers to any of the questions. It is important that you answer as many questions as you can. We are looking for your own answers, not what you think your doctors, family, or friends want you to say.

Don't feel like you have to spend a long time on each question. The first answer that comes to you is usually the best one. If you aren't sure how to answer a question, choose the best answer from the options given. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
