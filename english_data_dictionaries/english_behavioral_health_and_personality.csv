Participating in this survey will help us understand behavioral health concerns and how they affect overall health. This survey will take approximately 5 minutes to complete. At the completion of this survey, you will have the option to review individual results about your personality if you choose. The report is based on answering all questions in the personality traits section.

Please answer each question as honestly as possible. We are looking for your own answers, and not what you think your doctors, family, or friends want you to say.

Don't feel like you must spend a long time over each question. The first answer that comes to you is usually the best one. If you aren't sure how to answer a question, choose the best answer from the options given. Some questions also let you say if you don't know an answer or would rather not answer. Some of the questions may be sensitive. You can choose not to answer any question.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
