pm_intro,physical_measurements,,descriptive,"The purpose of this survey is to collect your height and weight. Physical measurements help researchers understand your health and risk of certain health conditions. There are two questions. We expect it will take less than one minute to complete this survey. We may ask you for more physical measurements in the future.

Please answer each question as honestly as possible. We are looking for your own answers, and not what you think others might want you to say. If you do not know your exact height and weight, use your best guess. You can leave the field blank if you are unable to answer.
