We are interested in addressing one of the most important health topics of our time: COVID-19 vaccination. Help us learn more by completing this short survey. Participating in this survey may help researchers around the world better understand the impact of COVID-19 during this challenging time. This survey will take about two minutes to complete. </p> <p>If possible, please have your vaccination card with you as you complete the survey.<br /><br />We will ask you about your vaccination experiences and any additional doses or booster shots of the vaccine you may have received. The questions we ask about additional doses include both ""booster doses"" (also called booster shots) and any ""additional full doses"". However, they do not include the first or second doses you may have received when you were initially vaccinated against COVID-19. <span style=""font-weight: normal;""><strong>To help you better understand and answer these questions, please read the definitions below.</strong></span></p> <ul> <li>Additional full dose: refers to additional doses of a vaccine given to people with moderately to severely weakened immune systems.</li> <li>Booster dose (also called booster shot): refers to another dose of a vaccine that is given to people who built enough protection after the initial full vaccination (two weeks after receiving 1 dose of J&J or two weeks after receiving the 2-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccine series) and do not have weakened immune systems.</li> </ul></div>",radio,"Did you receive the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccination?","COPE_A_44, Yes | COPE_A_13, No | cope_a_334, Not sure, I participated in a COVID-19 vaccination trial","Start Date: 6/10/2021; End Date: 03/08/2022",,,,,,,,,,,
